# ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS

### DIABETES PREDICTION USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS

- An artificial neuron network (neural network) is a computational model that mimics the way nerve cells work in the human brain
- Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use learning algorithms that can independently make adjustments - or learn, in a sense - as they receive new input
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS MODEL, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the model is calculated
